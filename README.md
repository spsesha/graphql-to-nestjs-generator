# GraphQL to NestJS Generator

This extension allows you to convert GraphQL SDL to NestJS code.

# Usage

To use the extension, select the SDL script you want to convert and hit `Shift + Alt + N` to generate the corresponding NestJS code.

The extension will generate the code replacing the selected SDL and format the code based on the current formatting options.

_Note: To disable the autoformatting of the code, you can set the `graphqlToNestJS.enableFormatting` option to `false` in the settings._
